Collision is buggy

	collision between ball and blocks

		some times collision will occur from too far away

		some times the ball will get caught inside the blocks and bounce around inside

		sometimes the ball goes straight through the block 

			kills block

			ball does not change direction

			>> seems to happen if the corners strike eachother at high speed
